# neural-turingmachine
Neural Turing Machine - Graves et al.

Utilizes a regular feedforward (recurrent is optional) neural network paired with an extensive memory system. Allows a network to read and write to memory using read/write heads. A neural counterpart to a turing machine.

Dependencies - Theano, Numpy
